   ## Challenges:-
   We had faced a lot of issues in cloning the website. First of all we were not used to reading the code of other people. I was working on the cart functionality which was in Landing page done by Aashish. There we faced some issues. We also sometimes had to fix some issues related to merging our code through github.

   ## Learning:-
   - We all became proficient in reading the code of team members.
- Our code writing style became cleaner as we had to think while writing code that other team member will be reading.
- We had to learn about many CSS properties that we didn’t know before.
- Our skills in Java Script and DOM manipulation became better.
- We all learned how to plan a project and execute that.
